My approach, 
I store the value to sort in a variable that I name (last),
I check if last is equal to 0.
if yes then I add last at the beginning of the array.
if no then I iterate over the array starting from the end, to the beginning,
I check that last is smaller than each element of the array.
If last is smaller I replace the previous element with the element. 
If last is bigger I replace the previous element with last.
